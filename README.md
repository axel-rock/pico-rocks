# Pico Rocks

[Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) is great.

I just wanted to add my own flavour to it. It's just a theme override, with what I'd call a "Scandinavian Startup" esthetic.

## List of changes over Pico.css

- Buttons are more rounded
- Uses an other font
- Slightly different spacings (padding, letter spacing, etc.)
- Smaller font size on big screens
- Different default colors
